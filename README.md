PiPod
=====

A side project to turn the Rasp Pi into a single use consumer device for the blind that plays the latest edition of a specified podcast (BBC's 'intouch' by default) 

It requires an oracle JVM - see http://www.savagehomeautomation.com/projects/raspberry-pi-installing-oracle-java-development-kit-jdk-170u-1.html and http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/raspberrypi-1704896.html

Which in turn requires the Debian soft float kernel.

Performance isn't too bad 20% cpu use to stream and decode.

Note oracle's instructions for enabling audio - this seems to be limited to root - but no matter.
